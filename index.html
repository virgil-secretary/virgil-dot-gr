            Virgil has moved to Milan in Michigan.
            <p>
            He is a bit lonely as expected, but sounds like he is settling in to living
            on the inside.  Read the website instructions carefully for more details.

            Frequent snail mail letters are encouraged. Snail mail MUST be in a
            plain white envelope and be written on plain white paper.  Letters
            may be typed or hand-written.  Do not enclose stamps.  Colors and
            illustrations are permitted.  Photos, however, must be sent via <a
            href="https://freeprints.com">freeprints.com</a>. For reasons still
            unclear, sometimes mail to him gets lost.  Although not required,
            sending via CERTIFIED MAIL guarantees he will receive it.
            Turnaround time is ~16 days.  Books must come new, mailed directly
            from Amazon. If you do send Virgil a book, he does not know who sent it.  So if you want a reply, please snailmail a letter around the same time.

            When corresponding with Virgil:
            <ul>
            <li>Include your phone number and email address.  He's sometimes able to use those to respond to you.
            <li>Number your pages, as they often get out of order when scanned by the prison.
            </ul>
