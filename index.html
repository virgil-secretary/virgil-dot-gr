                Virgil has plead guilty and is currently awaiting sentencing in January. Conditions are difficult, but
                overall, he is doing okay.
            <p>
                He is currently limited to one 15 minute phone call per day, which greatly limits his ability to talk
                to his friends and family. The best way to reach him is through <a
                    href="https://www.corrlinks.com/">CorrLinks</a>, where he can send and receive emails. He must first
                send you an invite before you can communicate. Please send an email to <a
                    href="mailto:secretary@virgil.gr?subject=CorrLinks&body=Hey it's _____, please give Virgil this email so he can send me messages, and let him know __________">secretary@virgil.gr</a>
                with the subject "CorrLinks" and we'll pass it along to him.
            <p>
                Needless to say, this is a very difficult time for him. He will need your support and friendship through
                CorrLinks messages. Just as more importantly, he will need letters of support from those who know him,
                to inform the judge of who he is and why he does not deserve a long sentence. We will have more
                information
                on the details of writing letters of support in December. Please let us know via an email to <a
                    href="mailto:secretary@virgil.gr?subject=Letter of Support&body=Hi, I'm _____ and I know Virgil from _______. I would like to write a letter of support for him, please let me know when there is more information.">secretary@virgil.gr</a>
                with the subject "Letter of Support" if you'd like to send a letter of support.
            <p>
                He is being held at the Manhattan Detention Complex in New York and will likely stay there until the sentencing in January. 
                He can receive letters in the mail at the address:
